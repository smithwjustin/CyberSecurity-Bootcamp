# LAN Exploitation

## Introduction
This week, you studied the penetration testing process, with an emphasis on tools for scanning and enumeration. In this assignment, you'll review and build on what you learned by scanning a network and exploiting targets much the same way you did in class, but without the guidance of your instructor.

The lab consists of four parts:
- Host Discovery
- Verification of Scan Data
- Target Host service Enumeration
- Exploitation of a Linux host

You'll be required to use everything you learned in class to complete the lab. The most important tools are:
- nmap / ZenMap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite

Be sure to refer to your class notes for more information on the tools and methodologies required to complete this assignment.

To launch the lab, log in, and use Ctrl/Cmd + F to search for the lab name **Pentesting & Network Exploitation: LAN Exploitation Capstone v2**.

Click the Launch button to start the lab.

Then, follow the instructions for **Parts 1 - 4** (**Enable Capstone Scoring** through **Exploit Linux Hosts**).
  
Please **take screenshots** after each step as outlined in the deliverables. 

Be prepared to discuss your solutions in class, and don't hesitate to reach out to your instructors (and classmates) for help.

## Getting started

Before getting started you'll need to understand workspaces and how they play a role in the hacking process.

**What are workspaces?**

In the most simplist definition, workspaces allow you to organize data about different targets during your penetration test. 

For example: let's say that you are performing a penetration test against a company. After completing the scanning phase of the penetration test, you will probably find targets with different operating systems, services installed, and  vulnerabilities. Associating each target with its own vulnerabilities in metasploit can quickly become overwhelming. Using workspaces, you are able to divide and associate each target with their own specific vulnerabilities in a simple organized manner.

Please read the following before getting started on your homework:

If you get lost or stuck don't worry! We'll be covering this more in the upcoming week.

## Metasploit Tips
You'll learn more about it next week, but note that Metasploit allows you to save the results of Nmap scans to a PostgreSQL database. This way, you don't have to say Nmap scans to files that you have to organize later.

Start by launching a Terminal in Kali. Then, start the PostgreSQL server and initialize the Metasploit database with the commands below.

  ```bash
  $ service postgresql start
  $ msfdb init
  ```

Now when you launch `msfconsole`, you can use `db_nmap` instead of nmap. It's the same as nmap, but saves scan results to a database.

You can find the IP addresses and services nmap discovered by issuing `hosts` and `services`, respectively.

Metasploit offers a variety of useful related commands. Run `help` to research them if you're interested.

- You will come across some new concepts in this homework that we haven't covered yet.

- Google is your friend. Here are some topics that may help:

    - Using Auxiliary Modules in Metasploit
    - Using netcat to send a manual `GET` request

- A great webpage of Metasploit commands can be found [HERE](https://offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/)

## Deliverables

**Take a screenshot after completing the final step in each set of instructions**, and to submit these screenshots as their solution.

**Good luck!**
