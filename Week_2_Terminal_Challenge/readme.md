## Unit 2 Homework Assignment: Keys to My Command Line

In this homework assignment, you will be using the concepts you've learned in class to complete **2 out of 3** Command-Line Challenges. 

Each of these challenges encompass a real-world situation where your new scripting skills will come in handy. 

Good luck! 

### Before You Begin

1. From within your Google Drive, create a folder called **02-Terminal_Challenge**. 

2. Right-click the **02-Terminal_Challenge** folder and select **Get Shareable Link**. You will use this folder to submit your homework when complete and the folder needs to be shareable so we can access it.

3. Inside your **02-Terminal_Challenge** folder, include two subfolders, one for each of the assignments.

## Challenge 1: Picture Tracker

In this challenge, you've been given a zipped file (Pictures.zip) filled with folders of images. Your job is to create a shell script to complete the following:

* Create three folders called: **JPG**, **PNG**, **TIFF**.

* Locate all **.jpg**, **.png**, and **.tiff** files inside the folder and copy each into their respective folder. 

* Create a new file called **PictureCounts.md**.

* Count how many times each file type occurs and log the results to the **PictureCounts.md** file. 

Your final submission should come in the form of: 

* A shell script (**.sh** file) with each of the commands with a comment above. Add a comment above each command describing the action.  

* An annotated PDF document with screenshots of each of the commands being run in the command line and the results shown in the file explorer when relevant. 

## Challenge 2: VIP Customers

In this challenge, you are given a zip file (OrderRecords.zip) filled with Order and Inventory Records from 2012–2017. Your task is to create and run a shell script to complete the following:

1. Create a folder called **AllRecords**. 

2. Copy all of the order records from 2012–2017 into the **AllRecords** folder. 

3. Inside of the **AllRecords** folder, create a folder called **VIPCustomerOrders**.

4. Find all orders from the VIP Customers Michael Davis or Michael Campbell. Include line and file names in the output.

5. Move these specific files into the **VIPCustomerOrders** folder in the form of two files: **michael_campbell_orders.output** and **michael_davis_orders.output**.

6. Create a file called **VIPCustomerDetails.md** that details how many orders each of the two users made. 

Your final submission should come in the form of: 

* A shell script (**.sh** file) with each of the commands. Add a comment above each command describing the action.  

## Challenge 3: To-Do Counter

![Images/02-Todo.jpg](Images/02-Todo.jpg)

In this challenge, you've been given zip file (Todos.zip) that includes a set of folders related to three coworkers' to-do lists. Each coworker's to dos are included in their respective folder. Your job is to create a shell script to complete the following:

1. Within each of the folders, create an **all.txt** file that combines the to dos included in the individual's to-do lists.

2. Within each of the folders, create a file called **done.txt** that includes only to dos marked as done.

3. Within each of the folders, create a file called **unfinished.txt** that includes only to dos not marked as done.

4. Create a file called **ProductivityReport.md** at the base of the **Todos** folder that specifies the number of to dos each person completed and the number they have left. **Note:** Because of the complexity of this activity, you do not need to use the script to print your results to the ProductivityReport, but you must use a script to do the counting.

5. Your final **ProductivityReport.md** might look something like the following:

    ```
    Done:
    Carrie: 12
    Jennifer: 3
    John: 8
    
    To Still Do:
    Carrie: 1
    Jennifer: 9
    John: 2
    
    ```

Your final submission should come in the form of: 

* A shell script (**.sh** file) with each of the commands with a comment above. Add a comment above each command describing the action.  

* An annotated PDF document with screenshots of each of the commands being run in the command line and the results shown in the file explorer when relevant.
